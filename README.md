 Kdapta-gtk-theme (forked from [Adapta](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme))
======

A custom fork of the [Adapta theme](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme).

I like my themes dark. Very dark. This is why I forked Adapta to create my custom version with a much darker dark version.

Before using Kdapta
-------------------
*Please follow the instructions from the [official Adapta repository](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme).*


Installing Kdapta
-----------------
For all options and requirements look at the [official Adapta repository](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme).

My favorite build is the following:

```bash
# The following command sets the build up to build with a nice orange accent.
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --enable-parallel --enable-gtk_next --with-selection_color=#f29404 --with-accent_color=#f5b44d --with-suggestion_color=#f29404 --with-destruction_color=#ff5c3a

make
sudo make install
```
